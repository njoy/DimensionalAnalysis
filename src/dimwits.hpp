/* Work around for lack of constexpr lambdas in C++14 */
/* Throughout the dimwits source, tag structs are used to create unique
 * instantiations of template classes, which are in turn used as types for 
 * constexpr variables. Ideally these tag structs would require no input on the
 * the part of the implementor. Lambdas are gaurunteed to be of a unique type,
 * and hence seem like a good candidate. However, because lambdas are not 
 * permitted to be specified in an unevaluated context (such as sizeof or 
 * decltype), and cannot be used within the scope of a constant expression 
 * (prior to C++ 17), some shennanigans are required.
 *
 * Here we leverage two properties
 * 1) both branches of the ternary operator must return the same type
 * 2) the nullptr can be implicitly converted to any pointer type as a constexpr
